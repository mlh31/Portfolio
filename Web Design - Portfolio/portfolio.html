                                    This illustration design is part of my collection to create a successful festival poster. I began this project by researching which type of festival poster I wanted to create that would express how I, as a designer, wanted to represent my skill set. The best way I found to do this was to look at my favourite type of graphic design work and created a mood board, the images I chose all correlated perfectly with a fashion festival so this is the festival choice I chose.
                                    <br><br> For this specific piece I wanted to create a bold graphic that would capture a viewer’s attention and appeal to the correct target audience, to do this I experimented with different colour variations, compositions and illustrations until I created something I thought represented fashion nicely as well as conveying a strong, bold theme made to attract my target audience of young women. I added some details like the festival name, the location, website and Facebook details to give the reader more information on the event and played with different hierarchy’s to ensure the information was conveyed properly and important information stood out.

                                    This project involved creating a professional magazine cover that tailors to a large target audience. I wanted to create a magazine that I could imagine being sold in shops and online worldwide. To do this, I started by looking at conventions and connotations of successful magazines that exist for similar target audiences, from this, I decided to place my model in front of the title as this is a common feature in famous magazines, such as Vogue, Elle and many other fashion magazines that tailor to the same target audience. I also believe that it draws the viewers’ attention into the model.
                                    <br><br> I include interesting and different typefaces for segments that could be found within the magazine and edited the foliage in the background of the image to appear three-dimensional. This was to help with the overall hierarchy of the page. I also placed my model directly in the middle of the page with her eyes looking at the viewer. This helps to draw viewers in and want to learn more. In order to create this design, I made use of Photoshop, especially layering to ensure the dimensional aspects where incorporated correctly.

                                    This project’s brief was to create an engaging festival poster for a decided target audience, I chose to create a fashion festival poster aimed at anyone from the age of 18 to 30. The reason I chose this age range was based on my research into the fashion industry at the general age range that is both inspired by fashion festivals and attend fashion festivals. <br><br> For this project, I made use of abstract shape and symmetry to create a vibrant and colourful feel whilst maintaining some form of order within the piece. I wanted to combine two opposites together to make a juxtaposing form of art created to entice the viewer to view this poster and to want to learn more about the festival being advertised. My process when creating this piece was more experimental than some of my other graphic design work, I began by starting to create a face, and decided this gave a good generalised shape, I then experimented by flipping this and having two versions of the same image facing each other. I then began adding random shapes and playing with the colour palette until I was happy, I then placed all of this inside of a box to frame the design and added some details about the festival.

                                    This project challenged my Photoshop skills and helped me to think outside of the box when experimenting with photo manipulation.
                                    <br><br> I experimented with many different ideas before settling on my theme of 'mother nature', but this process of trial and error helped me when expanding my knowledge with Photoshop. In all of my experimentations it was evident that a human figure was somewhat an importance in each, so I decided to manipulate images I had already collected and experiment with these. I made use of colour correcting to make sure the image had a good balance and didn't feel too unrealistic. <br> <br>I also played around with opacity and placed some bark going up the model's neck, this helped with the overall illusion that I wanted to represent. I felt that this project was extremely helpful to my personal development and technical skills and overall the image turned out fairly well. Photo manipulation is a powerful storytelling tool and it's a real asset when thinking about how to use my images in a different way.

                                    This poster design is one of my favourite graphic design pieces that I made. The project was to create a successful poster to promote an up and coming fashion festival. <br> <br>My process began by initially creating the main graphic of the character that would be the branding of the festival. Once I was happy with my character design, I began attempting to find the right colours and compositions to promote my festival whilst including all the relevant information. In order to do this, I wanted to create a title that fit my festival theme, was interesting and would look good as a brand. My main concern once working with this font was how I got the title to interact with the character, I originally wanted to have the font flowing with the outline of her hair, but soon found this to be very difficult to accomplish. I the began to look at the rule of thirds, here, I decided that the most effective way to visually portray my poster was to keep my character primarily on the left-hand side, with the title on the right and the information, the centre right. When I asked my peers what they thought of this design, they seemed to really like the idea behind it and the font worked well sitting next to the graphics. Overall this was my favourite design for this project.

                                    This was a self-led project, I wanted to create a poster that was unlike any of my others and experiment with different compositing and to enhance my technical skills when working with Photoshop and InDesign. I made use of clipping masks and layering to get my graphics in the correct place, I used a gradient on the page to add some depth and contrasting colours to make the poster more appealing. I envisioned this poster advertising a band's performance or a similar event and I think the layout works well and could be used for a variety of different poster designs. <br> <br> When I was creating the astronaut graphics for this piece I tried to encorporate texture into my design, to do this, I photographed and scanned in different pieces of tin foil and made use of clipping masks to get these to fit into where I wanted them. I think this technique really enhanced the graphics and makes them stand out, with the intention to draw in a viewer.

                                    This is an example of colour experimentation that I created when creating an illustration design, I really liked this style of colour experimentation as I could see how different colours worked well together and it made it easy to see the contrast between the character and the background image. This was a big part of my process when designing and it helped me pick and choose what works well and what doesn't. This was a great tool when experimenting with what would work with my target audience as it meant that I could ask my peers which colour coordination they think worked best and which they thought would not work very well. <br> <br> This collection of coloured graphics works so well together that I believe it could be a graphic piece itself. It reminds me of pop art and that's why I wanted to showcase it as one of my favourite works. This technique really helped me with future projects and experimenting with different colours.

                                    For this project, I used Processing and Arduino to create my own, interactive game. The concept behind the game was to shoot your opponents from your spaceship to win, it had 10 different levels that progressed in difficulty as the game did and a boss level at the end where the boss attempts to shoot you as well, and you have to avoid the shots in order to win.
                                    <br> <br> This was an extremely insightful project, but I particularly enjoyed creating the game graphics for the game, creating pixelated spaceships was a difficult task, but taught me the best ways to work with pixels in Photoshop. The different coloured spaceships represented different levels, for instance, if you hit a red spaceship, it would turn yellow, then green and so forth. I also incorporated bonus health and point icons that the user could collect when playing the game.

                                    This design is another experiment I created when attempting to create a successful fashion festival poster, I personally really like the overall feel that this piece has and how it's different from the other designs.
                                    <br><br> For this concept I really wanted to look at ways in which lines can be added or manipulated in a way that still doesn't completely overpower an image. I also wanted to experiment with different ways to place text and starts to become a structure itself. To do this I worked in Abode Illustrator and created the graphic of the girl first, once I was happy with this I played around with different compositions and felt unsatisfied keeping this design minimal with the character as the only statement item. Therefore, I added a striped background by using the pen and ruler tools and decided this worked nicely but needed something to break up the image. This is when I played around with the text. When I placed the text and changed the colour to the same red that the character featured I liked the overall feel and the purple contrasted the red nicely.

                        <div class="tooltip">These photos are all part of an album that I created to represent different themes. The main motive was to showcase a range of different techniques including composition, framing, lighting and editing. These photographs all represent something different within my chosen theme of colour. I chose this theme to show the importance of lighting and to showcase my abilities to capture colour. All of these pictures incorporate different technical elements and compositions. Experimentation was a key element in each design and helped me grow and learn how to navigate with a DSLR camera effectively. <br> This first picture in the collection was created for me to experiment with different colours after the picture had already been taken. I like the contrast between the sky and the dark objects within the sea as I think it gives the image depth. I also like the way the objects move into the sea, almost casting the viewers eyeline to view the larger picture. I used an ISO of 100 as it was a fairly well-lit scene, and this helped bring out the natural contrast in the clouds. The ratio and movement of the light to dark areas is what I like most about this piece. </div>

The child is looking directly into the camera to identify with the viewer, I have focused the lighting and composition around capturing the light in the eyes with a strong light framing part of the child’s face, the accentuated light on the eyelashes gives the image more depth and draws the viewers eye to the key part of the image- the eyes. To enhance these details, I have used an ISO of 800, to highlight areas, and a large aperture to help focus on the eyes and face.
                            <br> <br> This was an image that was very different from the other images in this album, but I liked the way that the lack of colour brought something completely new to the piece and created a different feel than any of the others had. Colour still plays a heavy part in making up this image with the majority of colour and reflection being shown in the eyes, I feel it brings he character to life. </div>

I wanted to highlight the idea that an object may act as some sort of obstruction to the natural beauty of a landscape, to enhance this idea, I have used an ISO of 400 to capture a moderate level of light for the settings, as well as a large aperture, meaning the majority of the image is kept in focus. My theme of colour is represented by the pop of orange against the contrasting green. The harsh colour difference makes the object stand out and look odd. <br><br>The light and composition in this image is designed to make the viewer see potential beauty taken over by something obstructive. Overall this image is a picture that makes use of technical skills such as depth and perception. I wanted to keep this picture neutral to its realistic state and therefore only edited the colour slightly when editing. </div>

This photograph was achieved from experimenting with different features my DSLR has to offer, I made use of the vibrant effect and created this shot with very little editing afterwards. <br> <br> It has several different reflection elements within, the light from beneath the water, making the water seem coloured as well as the reflections on the floor. I have focused on the composition of this piece by ensuring the timing was correct to get the water ascending, making the piece more comprehensive to the viewer. For this piece, I was inspired by the bright lights given off by the fountains and thought this gave an interesting vibe. I have used a high ISO of 3200, due to the lack of light, along with a large aperture and long exposure. This is to enhance the light that can be picked up by the camera and make it vibrant. </div>

I wanted to use colours that where similar and I think this worked well in bringing out any shine the image had to offer. I enhanced this by using a large ISO of 1600 to help bring out the darker shades along with a large aperture number to capture enough light to give details on the darker parts of the image and focusing on the central point, the rest of the image has a shallow depth of field which in effect draws the viewers eye to the main subject of the image. <br> <br>I think that the overall hierarchy of this image worked nicely and the way it looks as if the object within the image has just fallen over and spilled everywhere creates a realistic vibe, despite a lot of the image actually being set up to look that way. </div>

In this piece, I really wanted the viewer to notice the different between the light and dark parts of the picture and pay attention to all the different textures this piece has to offer. <br> <br> My ISO level is at 500 which helps to pick up the colours of the sunset and the darker areas of the structure. I have used a moderate aperture to ensure that the majority of the shot is focussed and crisp. I made use of editing the exposure after creating this shot to ensure that the sky wasn't over exposed. I also experimented with different angles and found that this angle flowed nicely.

The compositing in this photo is nice as it makes comprehensive sense to the viewer and is framed well. The way that the neck stretches into the photograph is aimed to guide the viewers eye with it, guiding the viewer to look at the main section of the image, which is the centre. <br> <br> I used a low ISO for this piece as the scene was lit well as it was in bright daylight, I also wanted to ensure that the main target of this piece was crisp and clear, with the background slightly blurred, so I edited the aperture accordingly. <br> <br> The contrast between blue and orange also work nicely together as it is a good mix of both cool and warm colours as well as complimentary colours that accentuate each other nicely. I particularly like the way the animal's print looks in this phot as it is clear, and the colours contrast the green, blue and grey background perfectly as the colours stand out and make the image far more interesting in my opinion. </div>

                        <div class="tooltip">I wanted to include this photo in the album as I feel it gives off a strong sense of character, theme and colour. The placement of the pumpkins looks coherent because of the interesting mix of colours that are being highlighted. By using lighter colours in the foreground of the image, the viewers eye is automatically targeted there, especially as the pumpkin in the centre is larger than the others, this creates a good hierarchy. I made sure to adjust the aperture to be focussed mainly on the pumpkin in the middle of the shot, meaning that the other pumpkins appear slightly out of focus. This again helps to add depth to the hierarchy and shows the viewer where to look. I made sure to edit the contrast and exposure after I cook this shot as it helped to ensure the shot wasn't over exposed and that the dark areas where brought out to contrast the light fruit. <br> <br> I like that in this image you can focus on all the different colours and it delivers a good sense of form, structure and textured despite the image being slightly messy in the sense that the pumpkins haven't been staged in this position, they were simply already like that. </div>

                        <div class="tooltip">This photograph is one of my favourites as it shows how depth of field can help enhance colours in the foreground that are similar to those in the background. This was a good test for me to pick up on certain colours and try to make them stand out without editing them. To do this I adjusted my aperture, so it would focus on the main element of the image, the bird, and enhanced the settings to captivate the best possible photograph. <br> <br> I think this photo works particularly well because of the specks of colour showing through in the bird's feathers. These add some form of contrast between the green colours and makes the bird stand out even more. The composition of the bird being in the middle also helps the viewer know where to look. The twigs within this frame also helps to frame this photograph nicely, the way in which they are structured like a triangle also helps guide the viewers eye into the centre of the piece.

        <h3>3-D MODELLING</h3>
        <img src="modelling.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="about">This project was to create 3-D elements inside a photographed frame and to make the 3-D element look realistic by manipulating the camera and lighting in Maya. This project was particularly challenging and was my first experience working in a 3-D modelling software. The main aim was to recreate the lights and camera within the room in a platform and apply textures and colours to the elements to make them seem realistic. <br> I am particularly proud of how this project turned out as I found it so challenging and learnt a new program in the process.
